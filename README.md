 The first task is an unsupervised model aimed at segmenting athletes into body performance groups, here it is identified that there are 4 distinct segments of athletes with factors such as age and gender contributing to the distinction between segments. Diastolic and systolic rates that determine blood pressure did not have a considerable impact on the segmentation.
 Task two is a regression task with the aim to build a model that can predict future bike rental demands, a random forest algorithm was used for this purpose. Furthermore, it was evident that temperature had a heavy impact on the bike rent demand rates and there was also a noticeable seasonality for the demand for bikes. On the other hand, factors such as humidity (%) and windspeed(m/s) did not have a significant relationship to bike rental demand.
 Task three is concerned with a classification model that aims to predict if a university student will dropout or not. Among many models used to train and test the data, the Random Forest model performed significantly better and hence is the chosen model for this predictive analysis. Moreover, by analysing the dataset, it was identified that scholarship holder, grades and course taken, had a strong impact on the number of dropouts while macro -economic factors such as inflation rate, unemployment rate and GDP did not have a vivid impact on the difference between students that dropout and those that do not.
